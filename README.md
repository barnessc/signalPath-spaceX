# SignalPathSpaceX

This project pulls launch data from the SpaceX API and renders it in an easy to use table format. Columns include Flight Number (sortable), Launch Year, Rocket Name, and Details. If you click on a row, and a press kit is available, you will be navigated to it.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
